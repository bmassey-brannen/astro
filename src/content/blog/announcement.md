## Introducing BMBlogs 2.0!

I'm thrilled to announce I have upgraded and rebuilt all of my website. It is now powered by Astro JS and hosted on GitHub Pages for free! When I embarked on the journey of building my original site using Vue JS & Firebase, it was a venture into the unknownâ€”primarily driven by curiosity and a desire to explore the possibilities. However, as I began writing more and updating the site, I soon realized that many of the tools I had previously relied upon were no longer actively maintained. This posed challenges when it came to implementing changes and adjustments.

Switching to Astro JS will grant me more control over my website's design and functionality, while also ensuring a smoother and more efficient user experience. I've taken this opportunity to revamp the home page, make modifications to the about page, and seamlessly migrate all my previous blogs. I'm excited that I have a new and easy way to deliver insightful posts and I look forward to sharing more content with you on this refreshed platform.
