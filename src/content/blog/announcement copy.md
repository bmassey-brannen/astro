## My New & Improved Website

I'm excited to share that I've recently rebuilt and upgraded my entire website! It is now powered by Astro JS and hosted on GitHub Pages at no cost.

Two years back, I built my original website from the ground up using Vue JS & Firebase. It was a huge accomplishment to build this first site, but I rarely touched it after it was finalized. Since then, life got busy, and the site remained pretty much the same.

Recently, as I started penning down more thoughts and wanted to give the site a fresh feel, I realized a lot of the old tools I relied on weren’t being maintained anymore. That brought its own set of challenges when I wanted to tweak things here and there.

Switching to Astro JS will grant me more control over my website's design and functionality, while also ensuring a smoother and more efficient user experience. I've taken this opportunity to revamp the home page, make modifications to the about page, and seamlessly migrate all my previous blogs. I'm excited that I have a new and easy way to deliver insightful posts and I look forward to sharing more content with you on this refreshed platform."

Can’t wait for you to check it out and share your thoughts! Enjoy exploring the new space, and stay tuned for more updates and stories coming your way!
